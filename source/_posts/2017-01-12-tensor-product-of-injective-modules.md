# Are tensor products of injective modules always injective?
There is a question^[1](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/623907/is-it-true-that-tensor-product-of-injective-modules-is-injective) on Math.Stackexchange asking this. Under it, a post provides two refrences for general criteria:

- Ishikawa, Takeshi. "On injective modules and flat modules." Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan 17.3 (1965): 291-296.
- Enochs, Edgar E., and Overtoun MG Jenda. "Tensor and torsion products of injective modules." Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 76.2 (1991): 143-149.

Here I give an example:

$R=K[x,y]/(x^2,xy,y^2), M=(x,y)$.
